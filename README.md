# 1. Animated scatter plot
Python’s plotly library can be used to create animated graphs, so we can use the Plotly library to visualize a scatter plot using Python.
In the code above, I am using a dataset provided by the plotly library itself. The dataset covers the GDP per capita of all countries. Here I am visualizing the GDP per capita of countries on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis.
# 2. Creating tables
The tabulate module in Python allows us to create and display data in a tabular format which makes the data look more readable. It can be used to organize our data to make it more understandable. Below are some of the data structures in Python which are supported by the tabulate module:

Lists/
Dictionary/
NumPy Array/
Pandas DataFrame.
# 3. Live Weather Updates
There are many ways to get live weather conditions for any city using the Python programming language. We can either use the weather APIs provided by third-party apps or We can also scrape the live weather data from a particular city.

If We are using weather APIs provided by any platform, We need to connect to their paid services to work with the weather APIs. But if We use our web scraping skills, it will be free.
To get the live weather conditions of any city using Python, first we have to install the BeautifulSoup library in Python.
# 4. Digital Clock
Starting with the Tkinter library in Python, which is a built-in package that comes with Python. 
Tkinter has some cool features that can be used to build simple apps.
Now let’s define the title and size of our application. 
We will set both the height and width of the resizable function as True(1,1) if we want a fixed window and don’t want to maximize or minimize the output we can set it to False(0,0)
will define the font of the time and its colour, its border width and the background colour of the digital clock:
will combine all the elements to define the label of the clock application:
define the main function of our digital clock. Here we will set the text of the label as the realtime and run and see our output.
# 5. Price Elasticity of Demand 
Price elasticity of demand refers to the degree of responsiveness of demand for a product to a change in price. Simply put, it means the degree to which the demand for a product changes with an increase or decrease in its price.
# 6. LCM using Python
I defined a Python function, where I used two parameters as a and b. Then I find the large number between the two numbers and divide the larger number with both the numbers in a while loop where the value of the larger number will be increased by 1 until we get 0 as a remainder. So this is how you can find the least common multiple of two numbers using the Python programming language.
# 7. Index of Minimum Value in a Python List
The above function implements an algorithm to find the index of the minimum value. It assumes that the list is not empty and the items on the list are in random order. It starts by treating the first item of the list as the minimum item, and then it searches for the smaller item to the right, and then, if it finds a smaller item as compared to the first, it resets the position of the minimum item. When it reaches the last item of the list, by following the same process, it returns the index of the minimum item.
# 7. Age calculator
To create an age calculator, we need two dates:

today’s date/
date of birth.
We can either ask the user for both dates or just ask for the date of birth and use today’s date from the computer itself. Asking for the birthday only seems like a more user-friendly option.
