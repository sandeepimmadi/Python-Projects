# 1. Age calculator
To create an age calculator, you need two dates:

today’s date/
date of birth.
You can either ask the user for both dates or just ask for the date of birth and use today’s date from the computer itself. Asking for the birthday only seems like a more user-friendly option. 
# 2. Creating tables
The tabulate module in Python allows us to create and display data in a tabular format which makes the data look more readable. It can be used to organize your data to make it more understandable. Below are some of the data structures in Python which are supported by the tabulate module:

Lists/
Dictionary/
NumPy Array/
Pandas DataFrame.
# 3. Live Weather Updates
There are many ways to get live weather conditions for any city using the Python programming language. You can either use the weather APIs provided by third-party apps or you can also scrape the live weather data from a particular city.

If you are using weather APIs provided by any platform, you need to connect to their paid services to work with the weather APIs. But if you use your web scraping skills, it will be free.
To get the live weather conditions of any city using Python, first we have to install the BeautifulSoup library in Python.
