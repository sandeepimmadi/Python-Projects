# Python-Projects
# 1. Age calculator
To create an age calculator, we need two dates:

today’s date/
date of birth.
We can either ask the user for both dates or just ask for the date of birth and use today’s date from the computer itself. Asking for the birthday only seems like a more user-friendly option. 
# 2. Creating tables
The tabulate module in Python allows us to create and display data in a tabular format which makes the data look more readable. It can be used to organize our data to make it more understandable. Below are some of the data structures in Python which are supported by the tabulate module:

Lists/
Dictionary/
NumPy Array/
Pandas DataFrame.
# 3. Live Weather Updates
There are many ways to get live weather conditions for any city using the Python programming language. We can either use the weather APIs provided by third-party apps or We can also scrape the live weather data from a particular city.

If We are using weather APIs provided by any platform, We need to connect to their paid services to work with the weather APIs. But if We use our web scraping skills, it will be free.
To get the live weather conditions of any city using Python, first we have to install the BeautifulSoup library in Python.
# 4. Digital Clock
Starting with the Tkinter library in Python, which is a built-in package that comes with Python. 
Tkinter has some cool features that can be used to build simple apps.
Now let’s define the title and size of our application. 
We will set both the height and width of the resizable function as True(1,1) if we want a fixed window and don’t want to maximize or minimize the output we can set it to False(0,0)
will define the font of the time and its colour, its border width and the background colour of the digital clock:
will combine all the elements to define the label of the clock application:
define the main function of our digital clock. Here we will set the text of the label as the realtime and run and see our output.
