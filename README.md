# 1. Age calculator
To create an age calculator, you need two dates:

today’s date/
date of birth.
You can either ask the user for both dates or just ask for the date of birth and use today’s date from the computer itself. Asking for the birthday only seems like a more user-friendly option. 
# 2. Creating tables
The tabulate module in Python allows us to create and display data in a tabular format which makes the data look more readable. It can be used to organize your data to make it more understandable. Below are some of the data structures in Python which are supported by the tabulate module:

Lists/
Dictionary/
NumPy Array/
Pandas DataFrame.
